			"comments": "this sketchbook was my project of last summer, i poured an entire like 3 weeks of my life into these pages. the notebook itself i got from some mean girls themed college event, which is why it was originally a burn book and the first page is actually a burn of my friend that i went to the event with (it's not featured here T-T). this was my first sketchbook and i love how it turned out. when i pick it up it crinkles, like it's so crunchy. in case you couldn't tell i love texture. not every page is amazing, but i guess that's the point of a sketchbook. enjoy scrolling through some of the featured pages :) the end goal for it was to make it into a zine which would go into the sketchbook, featuring the pages of the sketchbook, so it's like zineception. i think it'd be really cool to distribute the zines, maybe someday"
