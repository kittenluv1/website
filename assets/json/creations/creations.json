			"comments": "this is just a collection of things that i was too lazy to make a separate thing for each one. for the scaly dragon egg, the eos container i used is two different colors because i traded the top half with one of my best friends in elementary school. i used to collect those and look for diys to do with them all the time. there's also these little clay octopi that i made a bunch of at one point and even showed my friend how to make them as well. my favorites were these two tiny ones that sit on top of each other. and let me explain the poop, it was at the lake and me and grce and alicia found natural red clay in the dirt and made sculptures out of them, and the clay was actually really nice and has held up all the way until today. and it does bear a striking resemblance to poop. i also used to make these dioramas for my family for christmas every year, can you see the dog in the last one? :,)"
