`i went to an srs meeting today where students pitch their games that they want to make for people to join the team and help make the games. these people are so cool and have so many ideas and so much passion for what they do. 

i felt a bit (a lot) intimidated talking to them. i’m really bad at speaking up for myself in these kinds of situations. i’m generally not super outgoing anyways but especially with these kinds of things where i feel like i have to make an impression, i feel very shy and lowkey won’t talk unless spoken to. which is why i’m very bad at networking. but all the project leaders and artists or whatever were really nice, they would like explain their projects and answer questions with such passion, it was very nerdy and inspiring. 

sometimes i feel so overwhelmed looking at things that other people have made, but i have to remind myself that these are projects that have accumulated and grown over time and neocities.org was not built in a day. sometimes i see how cool and developed other peoples’ projects are and it makes me feel like i have nothing in comparison... i just feel overwhelmed

but i’m really proud of what i’m done and i bit the bullet and bought and set up a domain for my website today! i was waiting for a spark of genius to hit me and guide me towards the perfect name for my domain but i decided to just use the ol github username for now and if i decide to change it in the future i can just do that. that’s the great thing about the web, nothing is permanent…`

`when people talk about people they know, people they admire and people they love, i always wonder if they know. i wonder what they’re like, what they’re up to, and what they do, to have this person think of them so highly that they want to talk about them to other people. and sometimes you meet them and they’re a bit different than what you imagined, maybe not in a way that’s bad or good, just different, and it sometimes just makes you think - i wonder if they know.`

`i’m still kind of sick right now, just recovered from a nasty fever that had me shivering and sweating at the same time. i never get sick so that was pretty bad for me. i just wanted to write because i feel like my thoughts are kind of… lucid right now. i feel like there’s a voice in my head that’s narrating my thoughts, and also narrating my actions as i’m doing them and narrating out the thought of doing them. like i’m not just doing it but i’m cognitively aware of it. i told sun about it and she said congrats, you just unlocked neurodivergence. she told me the other day that i give neurotypical. which is so funny, cus it’s true.`

`today was such a chaotic day… i spent all morning trying to figure out relative file paths in github pages and i was wrestling with chatgpt for my life and thinking about it all throughout my cs lecture. at some point i semi gave up and decided to make a branch to isolate the testing environment a bit and then things all of a sudden just started working out. after i walked out of my cs lecture where i was busy thinking about my failing github pages, i realized my airpods were missing and i went back to track them down for almost an entire hour using findmy which was showing that they were literally right there in the classroom but they i looked everywhere and i think they’re lost forever. also la is burning and people are having to relocate and evacuate their homes. i really thought i wasn’t going to get thru it at multiple different occasions today, but life has a way of reminding you, there’s bigger disasters. so i think i’ll be fine`

`i promised i’d update today so here i am. this is reading like my journal lol. i woke up today with bad cramps that didn’t get better throughout the day. i took a cramp medicine from japan that doesn’t do anything and a prescription grade ibuprofen but that also wore off in a few hours. i’m using this heating pad right now on my stomach and it feels so nice. 

despite the constant aching and discomfort and fatigue that comes with the first day of your period, i was very brave today and persisted with my planned activities for the day. i did the resin dipping for my current preservation projects, the lizard, the dragonfly, and the random bug i brought back all the way from la. i also made a pickleball and racket from polymer clay while i was waiting for the resin to cure for my parents since i didn’t make them a christmas present this year. i’m trying a new method of applying the resin, i hung up each of the pieces with string and glazed them with resin and let gravity do the work of smoothing it out and making sure it doesn’t pool unevenly. it’s a bit finicky, and i lost a part of the dragonfly’s wing while applying the resin onto it, but that’s how resin always is. overall i think the method was quite a success. 

my table looks kind of crazy right now, lots of random supplies strewn all over and a bunch of dead bugs and reptiles hanging from a homemade hanging rack contraption thing made from a clorox wipe dispenser and duct tape. i’m going to let this coat cure and then apply another one tomorrow before my mandatory outing with my mom’s acquaintances. and then break will be over so so soon.`

		title: "second day of the new year - snowboarding for the second time",

`i had a very eventful second day of the year. i went snowboarding with peony, she drove us down and i met up there with elena and her dad and her friend and they took me up the mountain for the first time on a snowboard. i do not remember those slopes being so steep on when i went was on skis, i was terrified T-T elena’s dad took me down corkscrew first and then sugar n’ spice, they’re both greens but corkscrew is way scarier in theory. the first run i wasn’t used to the slope or the speed and i kept leaning back and basically just being scared and not committing and i ate so much snow TT full on like tumbling and catching edges everywhere. but elena’s dad was so patient and waited for me on both of my first runs of the two green trails, thank god for him. i would like eat it and then just sit there to recover for a bit and he was just sitting there waiting for me TT it was really nice of him. afterwards i went to take a much needed break and i caught up with peony who was having her own winter arc on the mountain TT i tried to teach her about edges and stuff but it’s best to just do it. i told her to follow me down the slope one time so she could learn and i started doing a steep s-turn and then i turn around and she’s flying down the mountain like already halfway down TT i’m like well ok TT after that run there was only one more hour left until the resort closed and i was so ravenous and aching so me and peony went to take a break at the lounge area. i bought her a dirty chai and i got myself a drink and ate a protein bar to fill my stomach. those refreshments were so needed, i see why they’re called refreshments now. 

then i went for one more run on green by myself and oh boy i’m honestly not sure i should have taken that run. first i caught a nasty front edge and i had to just sit there and catch my breath for a second just groaning to myself, and then i got a cramp in my left foot and sat down to wait it out, and then i got a cramp in my right foot, and while i was waiting that one out i ran into a guy who used to volunteer with my nonprofit. and i was like no way crazy seeing you here. he was skiing with his girlfriend and it looked like it was her first time and he was teaching her but it was actually such a crazy coincidence. anyways after that interaction i decided it was finally time get off my butt and go down the mountain and i actually took corkscrew with only 1 fall… i actually barely fell on that last green run and i felt much more in control and less afraid of the speed, so i’m glad i went. but that definitely was the last run, it literally took me like 50 minutes T-T i’m not going to be able to walk normally tomorrow

coming back was so fun, peony drove while i queued songs and together we sang and were blinded by the brightness of the setting tahoe sun. we beat traffic by leaving just before the last chair lift. those 10 minutes really make a big difference traffic-wise. and as i said i couldn’t have done any more even if i wanted to TT when we got home i immediately changed into my pajamas and we made hot ramen together and watched american psycho. i totally didn’t get it at first but peony explained it to me and her explanation made sense. she’s helping me return the snowboards tomorrow too she’s a great friend T-T i also did another lice treatment today because you’re supposed to do one 7 days after your first treatment anyways (which would have been yesterday but i was busy) and i was having deja vu paranoia from the last time i went to bed without washing my hair after snowboarding TT

my website on github pages is kinda spazzing out rn, git and github are kinda both totally new to me but i’m going to put a pin on addressing those issues for now to direct my focus to some other side quests that i have been neglecting this break such as my preservation projects and getting ready for winter quarter and the new year. we’ll see how much progress i can make on those tonight, but i plan to work on preservation all day tmrw. will lyk how it goes ;)`

`[resolutions redacted]

overall lol ok it’s kinda cringe. idk why i think i changed so much from last year to this year but actually like for real this time. ig i change a lot every year but i feel like i changed in a different way this year. i just want to cement in that change lowkey because i like who i’ve become. that first one idek what i was talking about but i dont even agree with it rn TT mb the creativity part. but i think that was still me trying to be someone i really wasn’t. trying to be someone else. but maybe all that talk about self actualization actually helped me become the way i am now. the way i dont care about that stuff anymore lowk that’s the true realized self. i guess i am more weak now, i think i was onto something with that, i am weak in a way that i accepted things about myself that i previously considered to be flaws and now consider them my strengths. and i decided to live by them. and the friendships… i think that happened all on its own :) along with everything else. 

now that thats out of the way i am ready to put 2024 behind me and move on to 2025 *-*`

`yesterday i showed my japan video to my parent’s friends at our new year’s party and i don’t think it really reached the right audience. they kept asking questions about what was going on in the video and telling me to explain it but they were just kind of talking over it instead of watching and experiencing it. some kids my age were there too, but i really don’t think it was the right audience. i was trying to keep myself calm by just focusing and taking comfort from my own video, but it all was actually very overstimulating and lowkey made me want to cry. but i had to remind myself that their reactions to my art don’t determine its worth or change anything about it including my opinion of it. and you can’t control people’s reaction to your art, but you can only show it to everyone and let the art speak to whoever it speaks to. and anyways, i’m proud of myself for showing my art. even if the reaction wasn’t ‘successful’ or amazing, i think every person who sees my art, regardless of their reaction, is a win. 

anyways the reactions i got yesterday weren’t all bad - the video got described as a 2010’s youtube vlog which i appreciated and took as a compliment, and my one friend who was there, i know she got it. i also showed it to peony before the guests came and she liked it. she got it. `
