i used to try to do everything at once, like all my hobbies at least once a day, and that is so unsustainable guys don’t try it. especially if they’re new hobbies. it was so overwhelming and they just became tasks to check off every day instead of hobbies! now i basically just work on one project a day, if i have time, and kind of rotate around whatever i feel like doing on a particular week.

i’m going to have to table learning how to draw for now, though, because i’m currently still in the programming curve, but i already have projects building up… mainly making graphics and assets for my website and such. at some point those projects are going to get overwhelming, in a good way, until i feel like i need to draw. and then i will draw.`

the party was so amazing… the band, the mosh pit, the fit, i was feeling everything. and i was feeling really open to everything too, for the first time. it was also my first time being in a real mosh pit that actually moshes. it was too chaotic, i got outta there so fast, but i stayed the rest of the night on the edge where there’s more room to push and get pushed and it was actually so fun. 

the party ended way too early! but afterwards me and nate and soleil got cheese fries from fat sal’s and we went to soleil’s apartment and sat and talked through the munchies. so much fun.`

`<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 0.9rem">Hi Henry. I just got Morgan's DNA results and she's mostly Australian Cattle Dog. The full list is attached. 

She keeps amazing us every day. My husband is finally home and he is really enjoying her. 

Please forward this to your daughter as she wanted to see the results.

Thanks again for sharing her with us. She is cherished.</span>

this makes me tear up. i do see the australian cattle dog in her, she was always suspiciously long for a golden retriever. apparently she’s like 4% golden retriever and 3% american spaniel, and those were the two breeds we used to say she was. she’s like over 50% herding breeds which makes sense, she used to always like to be where ever we were. we always used to joke about how she couldn’t fetch as a retriever, and she didn’t like water… turns out she just wasn’t a retriever. she’s a good healthy mix, 0 at risk conditions :p i wonder where her color comes from. they’re also changing her name to morgan i guess, i wonder how she’s responding to that. she’s a smart girl, she’ll get it

i felt a bit (a lot) intimidated talking to them. i’m really bad at speaking up for myself in these kinds of situations. i’m generally not super outgoing anyways but especially with these kinds of things where i feel like i have to make an impression, i feel very shy and lowkey won’t talk unless spoken to. which is why i’m very bad at networking. but all the project leaders and artists or whatever were really nice, they would like explain their projects and answer questions with such passion, it was very nerdy and inspiring. 

sometimes i feel so overwhelmed looking at things that other people have made, but i have to remind myself that these are projects that have accumulated and grown over time and neocities.org was not built in a day. sometimes i see how cool and developed other peoples’ projects are and it makes me feel like i have nothing in comparison... i just feel overwhelmed

but i’m really proud of what i’m done and i bit the bullet and bought and set up a domain for my website today! i was waiting for a spark of genius to hit me and guide me towards the perfect name for my domain but i decided to just use the github username for now and if i decide to change it in the future i can just do that. that’s the great thing about the web, nothing is permanent…`

despite the constant aching and discomfort and fatigue that comes with the first day of your period, i was very brave and persisted with my planned activities for the day. i did the resin dipping for my current preservation projects, the lizard, the dragonfly, and the random bug i brought back all the way from la. i also made a pickleball and racket from polymer clay while i was waiting for the resin to cure for my parents since i didn’t make them a christmas present this year. i’m trying a new method of applying the resin, i hung up each of the pieces with string and glazed them with resin and let gravity do the work of smoothing it out and making sure it doesn’t pool unevenly. it’s a bit finicky, and i lost a part of the dragonfly’s wing while applying the resin onto it, but that’s how resin always is. overall i think the method was quite a success. 

my table looks kind of crazy right now, lots of random supplies strewn all over and a bunch of dead bugs and reptiles hanging from a homemade hanging rack contraption thing made from a clorox wipe dispenser and duct tape. i’m going to let this coat cure and then apply another one tomorrow before my mandatory outing with my mom’s acquaintances. and then break will be over so so soon.`

`i had a very eventful second day of the year. i went snowboarding with peony, she drove us down and i met up there with elena and her dad and her friend and they took me up to the top of the mountain. i do not remember those slopes being so steep when i went on skis, i was terrified. elena’s dad took me down corkscrew first and then sugar n’ spice, they’re both greens but corkscrew is way scarier in theory. the first run i went on i wasn’t used to the slope or the speed and i kept leaning back and basically just being scared and not committing and i ate so much snow TT full on like tumbling and catching edges everywhere. but elena’s dad was so patient and waited for me, thank god for him. i would like eat it and then just sit there to recover for a bit and he was just sitting there waiting for me TT. afterwards i went to take a much needed break and i caught up with peony who was having her own winter arc on the mountain. i tried to teach her about edges and stuff but it’s best to just do it. one time i told her to follow me down the slope so she could learn and i started doing a steep s-turn and then i turn around and she’s flying down the mountain like already halfway down. 

i went for one last run on the green trail by myself and oh boy i’m honestly not sure i should have taken that run. first i caught a nasty front edge and i had to just sit there and catch my breath for a second just groaning to myself, and then i got a cramp in my left foot and sat down to wait it out, and then i got a cramp in my right foot, and while i was waiting that one out i ran into a guy who used to volunteer with my nonprofit that i literally thought i would never see again. anyways after that interaction i decided it was finally time get off my butt and go down the mountain… i actually barely fell on that whole run and i felt much more in control and less afraid of the speed, so i’m glad i went. but that definitely was the last run, it literally took me like 50 minutes to complete T-T i’m not going to be able to walk tomorrow

coming back was so fun, peony drove while i queued songs and together we sang and were blinded by the brightness of the setting tahoe sun. we beat traffic by leaving just before the last chair lift. those 10 minutes really make a big difference traffic-wise. and as i said i couldn’t have done any more even if i wanted to TT when we got home i immediately changed into my pajamas and we made hot ramen together and watched american psycho. i totally didn’t get it at first but peony explained it to me and her explanation made sense. she’s helping me return the snowboards tomorrow too she’s a great friend T-T i also did another lice treatment today because you’re supposed to do one 7 days after your first treatment anyways (which would have been yesterday but i was busy) and i was having deja vu paranoia from the last time i went to bed without washing my hair after snowboarding TT

my website on github pages is kinda spazzing out rn, git and github are kinda both totally new to me but i’m going to put a pin on addressing those issues for now to direct my focus to some other side quests that i have been neglecting this break such as my preservation projects and getting ready for winter quarter and the new year. we’ll see how much progress i can make on those tonight, but i plan to work on preservation all day tmrw. will lyk how it goes ;)`

i had to remind myself that their reactions to my art don’t determine its worth or change anything about it. and you can’t control people’s reaction to your art, but you can only show it to everyone and let the art speak to whoever it speaks to. and anyways, i’m proud of myself for showing my art. even if the reaction wasn’t ‘successful’ or amazing, i think every person who sees my art, regardless of their reaction, is a win.`
