- going on an overseas trip and slowly leaving all your responsibilities behind
- falling too deep in the no strings attached relationship
- that one beach side drive that you will never forget
- going out in a foreign country with your friend who's really good at making friends and having the best clubbing experience of your life
- hitting the japanese onsen with the girls... friends who bathe together stay together
- struggling to figure out your coworkers only to realize most of us are just strong introverts
- missing your connecting flight home and living out the actual last 24 hours of your time in japan in the airport
- losing both grandpas in the span of a few weeks, making you contemplate loss, family, and growing up
- healing while reconnecting with my hometown and learning more about my family and myself
- having no agency for privacy as a yet-to-be-homeowner and getting caught in the act by the police
- losing contact and getting back in touch with people slightly above my age and thinking soon, that will be us... 
- having the best summer of your life (somehow again), and realizing you never want to grow up`

(i've come to realize that i'm not good at this, and i'll take things too hard if they aren't, and take them to heart if they are. but that creates its own sort of balance). embrace your flaws and your vulnerabilities. come to terms with everything about yourself and accept yourself fully. be a student - accept criticism, stay curious, and enjoy being a beginner. 

do the work more than you talk about the work. don't compare. don't complain. don't forget that reality exists outside of your head. develop a genuine interest in others. put others' needs above your own; embrace others' flaws as well as your own. notice when you feel defensive, prideful, creative, or self-important... notice the ego. and then go outside and let it go`

`do you ever have a bunch of tasks to do and feel so overwhelmed with how much there is and how when you start doing one thing it reminds you that you have to do another thing and it gets so overwhelming you just want to drop everything and lay down? i've developed a workflow for myself where i just do things as i think of them, even if i'm in the middle of doing something else, so if i realize i need to do another task first in order to do this one i just go do that one and if in the middle of that task i realize there was something else i forgot to do a while ago, i'll go do that one before i forget. it's like a recursive pattern instead of an iterative one... it's not necessarily finish one task and onto the next... which is kind of what it feels like most of us have been taught or conditioned to do. that is after all the essence of the to do list. usually i'll set some kind of physical reminder to come back to the previous task, or if it's like an online task i'll keep a tab open or something. but yea i've learned to not try to govern too much when or in what exact order the tasks get done in, or else i would just end up thinking too much about what task is the most important or which task might affect another slightly and the dependency graph gets a little too complicated and my head overheats and i have to sit and let it cool down for a bit. so instead i just choose something to do, anything, and start doing it, and it's better than doing nothing. and then i go into work periods where i just do tasks as i think of them, and usually i'll get pretty immersed in a task before it reminds me to do another one and if i feel like switching gears right then i'll go ahead and do the other one instead. this helps me a lot with not thinking too much about everything i need to be doing, and just doing something. but also, there's definitely times when i'm trying to do everything and i really just need to sit down and choose one thing and finish it first, before really moving on to the next. this is usually when i'm procrastinating a task that i don't want to do and i end up doing anything and everything else instead of this one task that i keep having to come back to and eventually it becomes more of a mind block than just another regular task. and then sometimes you just gotta grit your teeth and just work on something, even if you don't feel like it or it doesn't fit your flow. sometimes work just feels like work, and that's ok too`

`we walk in there and i see two lifeless looking people, each in separate beds on either side of the hospital room. luckily my grandpa is the less lifeless looking one, the one by the window. i recognize him from the rare times i make a guest appearance on his video calls with my mom - he looks a bit better here in person, without the beautifying whitening filter from those international video calls. 

they ask him if he recognizes who i am, and his first guess is my mom before he recognizes that it's me. he cries out my name and reaches his hands up, clapping and celebrating in joy. his fingers are frail but his skin is soft and smooth. i hold his hand and smile, not sure how to receive his excitement. 

he can't quite get it through his head that my mom is coming to visit him in two months, after i leave, and he keeps asking where she is and when is she coming. it's difficult to communicate with him, easier than over a video call, but i don't understand the kunming accent and his hearing is starting to fade with his clarity. he accepts the panda stuffed animal that i give him but doesn't seem to like or dislike it. he doesn't seem to quite understand that it's a gift. perhaps he would have appreciated it more if i had given him something a bit more practical... like if i had brought my mom with me instead. 

he's been laying in a bed for years now, unable to even sit up, his back crumbling beneath him as the tissues slowly shrink and soften, yet he still recognizes me and my mom and my dad when i show him a pictures of us on my phone. he mentions how lonely he is when there's no one there to talk to, and i realize that he probably just sleeps and looks forward to seeing his family visit him in the hospital all day. it makes me sad to think about, what little reprieve he gets from his body, when his only company is his caretaker and his thoughts. 

my aunt is trying to leave and he wants us to stay a bit longer, but she's already fed him his soup and changed out his blankets and she's ready to go. he goes back and forth with her for a little bit while she rubs the muscles in his legs, but at the end he kind of laughs a little and gives up, and i wonder which parts of that whole exchange he understood and which parts he's experienced many times before. my aunt is so calloused to it all, but i can't even begin to imagine how she thinks of it, how it felt to watch things slowly progress through the years up to the way i'm seeing them now. for me, this is an important family reunion and an experience, for her this is just her life.`

i have a bad habit of holding my tongue, but i couldn't stop thinking about how things were coming to an end, and what's the point of saying all this when it's all just going to come to the same end. maybe i focus too much on the outcome. but it's not less real because it's temporary. 

i cried a little when the plane was taking off, and it hit me just how final it would be this time, how much it felt like a real goodbye. i kept thinking about how after those few weeks are over, someday we would just be another part of each other's past. i think i just think too much... but i also know that even though it's sad and brings tears to my eyes right now, when i look back on it in the future, it will be the fun memories and not sad ones that i remember first.

i think stickers are too permanent for me, and yet in a way also too temporary. even when i finally commit to choosing one, then i'll worry that it will lose its hold over time and peel or fall off. i should accept that that's a natural part of the life cycle of stickers, some fall off and some get scratched up and the ones that stick through to the end are the ones that were meant to stick`

`my life is definitely shaped by the fact that I'm an only child. i grew up an only child with working parents, and I taught myself how to entertain myself and how to stay busy. if I had a sibling, I would definitely be a different person than I am now, probably for the better but not guaranteed. and the reason for that is what if my sibling was some kind of computer wiz or child genius or something like that, and I developed some kind of inferiority complex, or what if I was the child genius and my sibling was just kind of slow or whatever and I developed a superiority complex. but if there was a way that I could have a sibling and guarantee that I had a healthy sibling dynamic with my sibling then I would definitely trade that for being an only child, but there's no way for me to do that and there's also no way for me to guarantee that...`

`...tonight i went to spring sing with chloe, it was nice but i was lowkey stressing during it. and then i came back and worked on the homework assignment that was due 2 days ago and i code so slowly and i really only just got started on it but that's the hardest part like reviewing all the materials and getting the assignment started and then once you gain momentum on it it's really not that bad. i stayed up until like 3 to work on it and then scrolled on instagram for another 2 hours but i was like this is ok as long as i'm working i feel a bit better i feel proud of myself for at least having started on it and working hard until 3. and i always admire when people push themselves and i just remembered that i can do that too... i think a key tho is that i'm actually starting to enjoy the work again instead of just like an overwhelming feeling of dread in my heart whenever i think about working on anything productive... 

next year i want to be wayyyy less busy and focus on a few things that are important to me and do my own side projects and just hone my craft. i think this quarter  i've tested my upper limits of how much work i can take on without feeling like constant suffering and let's just respect that limit in the future. i'm finally feeling like there's not so much work to do but so much stuff to do and i want to keep it that way...i can do this`

`last night I spent the whole night “preparing“ for my interview, but to be honest I just spent a lot of time procrastinating and pretending i was doing things that would prepare me like scrolling reddit and watching ‘how to interview' videos. I don't know why I just didn't feel like preparing for it. this morning I got up kind of early and got ready and I did a little bit of prepping answers and such I guess, but I honestly didn't prepare that much, not nearly as much as the ucla interview but honestly, I think I did fine. I think I have enough experiences to draw on and fall back on for most standard dev interview questions and it wasn't technical in any way. and also I think there's kind of a bell curve when preparing for interviews where if I try to write down all my answers and overprepare and memorize them all and then try to recall them during the interview it's really bad because then I tripp up over my words and I can't keep track of where my point is coming from or where it's going. but if I just brainstorm a little bit before, think about some talking points that I could potentially say but leave lots of room for me to think in realtime about the question and respond to it in a way that I think is the most appropriate, that makes for a much more thought out but also put together response with much more flow and more me. so mostly what I did to prepare for this interview was just talk about some projects i did, obviously do some research into the company but think about some things that I thought would be relevant to the interview. and right before the interview kind of just warm-up talking by literally just talking to myself about anything, about my projects, my website, about myself. and then during the actual interview there was a lot of things that I brought up in the interview that I didn't even anticipate talking about but it worked out because i allowed my mind to stay flexible enough to find the experience that i felt best fit the question and that i could articulate most intelligently at that point in time and this specific stage in my life. another note is do not trust the estimated remaining battery life on your computer because mine literally died on me in the middle of it, but it was fine i just grabbed my charger and came back`

i used to try to do everything at once, like all my hobbies at least once a day, and that is so unsustainable guys don't try it. especially if they're new hobbies. it was so overwhelming and they just became tasks to check off every day instead of hobbies! now i basically just work on one project a day, if i have time, and kind of rotate around whatever i feel like doing on a particular week.

i'm going to have to table learning how to draw for now, though, because i'm currently still in the coding curve, but i already have projects building up... mainly making graphics and assets for my website and such. at some point those projects are going to get overwhelming, in a good way, until i feel like i need to draw... and then i will draw (ദ്ദി˙ᗜ˙)`

Please forward this to your daughter as she wanted to see the results.

Thanks again for sharing her with us. She is cherished.</span>

this makes me tear up. i do see the australian cattle dog in her, she was always suspiciously long for a golden retriever. apparently she's like 4% golden retriever and 3% american spaniel, and those were the two breeds we used to say she was. she's like over 50% herding breeds which makes sense, she used to always like to be where ever we were. we always used to joke about how she couldn't fetch as a retriever, and she didn't like water... turns out she just wasn't a retriever. she's a good healthy mix, 0 at risk conditions :p i wonder where her color comes from. they're also changing her name to morgan i guess, i wonder how she's responding to that. she's a smart girl, she'll get it

sometimes i feel so overwhelmed looking at things that other people have made, but i have to remind myself that these are projects that have accumulated and grown over time and neocities.org was not built in a day. sometimes i see how cool and developed other peoples' projects are and it makes me feel like i have nothing in comparison... i just feel overwhelmed

but i'm really proud of what i'm done and i bit the bullet and bought and set up a domain for my website today! i was waiting for a spark of genius to hit me and guide me towards the perfect name for my domain but i decided to just use the github username for now and if i decide to change it in the future i can just do that. that's the great thing about the web, nothing is permanent...`

`i'm still kind of sick right now, i just recovered from a nasty fever that had me shivering and sweating at the same time. i never get sick so that was very bad for me. i just wanted to write because i feel like my thoughts are kind of... lucid right now. i feel like there's a voice in my head that's narrating my thoughts, and also narrating my actions as i'm doing them and narrating the thought of deciding to do those actions. like i'm not just doing it but i'm cognitively aware of doing it and making the conscious decision to do it. i told sun about it and she said congrats, you just unlocked neurodivergence. she told me the other day that i give neurotypical. which is funny, cus it's true.`

`today was such a chaotic day... i spent all morning trying to figure out relative file paths in github pages and i was wrestling with chatgpt for my life to try to get my pages to actually show up in github pages and was thinking about it all throughout my cs lecture. at some point i semi gave up and decided to make a branch to isolate the testing environment a bit and then all of a sudden things just started working out. after i walked out of my cs lecture where i was busy thinking about my failing github pages, i realized my airpods were missing and i went back to track them down for almost an entire hour using the findmy app which was showing that they were literally right there in the classroom but they i looked everywhere and i think they're lost forever. also la is burning and people are having to relocate and evacuate their homes. i really thought i wasn't going to get thru it at multiple different occasions today, but life has a way of reminding you, there's bigger disasters. so i think i'll be fine`

`it's the sixth day already... first day of winter quarter and i need to go to work soon but i can't believe the quarter is already starting. i feel like i'm still trying to transition from it being break and wrapping things up but i'm almost done. some things that i'm living by this quarter: 
- it's always okay to not do your homework to do art
- fall more and fall better`

`i promised i'd update today so here i am. this is reading like my journal lol. i woke up today with bad cramps that didn't get better throughout the day. i took a cramp medicine from japan that doesn't do anything and a prescription grade ibuprofen but that also wore off in a few hours. i'm using this heating pad right now on my stomach and it feels so nice. 

despite the constant aching and discomfort and fatigue that comes with the first day of your period, i was very brave and persisted with my planned activities for the day. i did the resin dipping for my current preservation projects, the lizard, the dragonfly, and the random bug i brought back all the way from la. i also made a pickleball and racket from polymer clay while i was waiting for the resin to cure for my parents since i didn't make them a christmas present this year. i'm trying a new method of applying the resin, i hung up each of the pieces with string and glazed them with resin and let gravity do the work of smoothing it out and making sure it doesn't pool unevenly. it's a bit finicky, and i lost a part of the dragonfly's wing while applying the resin onto it, but that's how resin always is. overall i think the method was quite a success. 

my table looks kind of crazy right now, lots of random supplies strewn all over and a bunch of dead bugs and reptiles hanging from a homemade hanging rack contraption thing made from a clorox wipe dispenser and duct tape. i'm going to let this coat cure and then apply another one tomorrow before my mandatory outing with my mom's acquaintances. and then break will be over so so soon.`

		title: "second day of the new year - snowboarding for the second time",
		date: "1/2",

`i had a very eventful second day of the year. i went snowboarding with peony, she drove us down and i met up there with elena and her dad and her friend and they took me up to the top of the mountain. i do not remember those slopes being so steep when i went on skis, i was terrified. elena's dad took me down corkscrew first and then sugar n' spice, they're both greens but corkscrew is way scarier in theory. the first run i went on i wasn't used to the slope or the speed and i kept leaning back and basically just being scared and not committing and i ate so much snow TT full on like tumbling and catching edges everywhere. but elena's dad was so patient and waited for me, thank god for him. i would like eat it and then just sit there to recover for a bit and he was just sitting there waiting for me TT. afterwards i went to take a much needed break and i caught up with peony who was having her own winter arc on the mountain. i tried to teach her about edges and stuff but it's best to just do it. one time i told her to follow me down the slope so she could learn and i started doing a steep s-turn and then i turn around and she's flying down the mountain like already halfway down. 

i went for one last run on the green trail by myself and oh boy i'm honestly not sure i should have taken that run. first i caught a nasty front edge and i had to just sit there and catch my breath for a second just groaning to myself, and then i got a cramp in my left foot and sat down to wait it out, and then i got a cramp in my right foot, and while i was waiting that one out i ran into a guy who used to volunteer with my nonprofit that i literally thought i would never see again. anyways after that interaction i decided it was finally time get off my butt and go down the mountain... i actually barely fell on that whole run and i felt much more in control and less afraid of the speed, so i'm glad i went. but that definitely was the last run, it literally took me like 50 minutes to complete T-T i'm not going to be able to walk tomorrow

coming back was so fun, peony drove while i queued songs and together we sang and were blinded by the brightness of the setting tahoe sun. we beat traffic by leaving just before the last chair lift. those 10 minutes really make a big difference traffic-wise. and as i said i couldn't have done any more even if i wanted to TT when we got home i immediately changed into my pajamas and we made hot ramen together and watched american psycho. i totally didn't get it at first but peony explained it to me and her explanation made sense. she's helping me return the snowboards tomorrow too she's a great friend T-T i also did another lice treatment today because you're supposed to do one 7 days after your first treatment anyways (which would have been yesterday but i was busy) and i was having deja vu paranoia from the last time i went to bed without washing my hair after snowboarding TT

my website on github pages is kinda spazzing out rn, git and github are kinda both totally new to me but i'm going to put a pin on addressing those issues for now to direct my focus to some other side quests that i have been neglecting this break such as my preservation projects and getting ready for winter quarter and the new year. we'll see how much progress i can make on those tonight, but i plan to work on preservation all day tmrw. will lyk how it goes ;)`

`yesterday i showed my japan video to my parent's friends at our new year's party and i don't think it really reached the right audience. they kept asking questions about what was going on in the video and telling me to explain it but they were just kind of talking over it instead of watching and experiencing it. i was trying to keep myself calm by just focusing and taking comfort from my own video, but it all was actually very overstimulating and lowkey made me want to cry.

i had to remind myself that their reactions to my art don't determine its worth or change anything about it. and you can't control people's reaction to your art, but you can only show it to everyone and let the art speak to whoever it speaks to. and anyways, i'm proud of myself for showing my art. even if the reaction wasn't ‘successful' or amazing, i think every person who sees my art, regardless of their reaction, is a win.`
