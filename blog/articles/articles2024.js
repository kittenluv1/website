`so you know how i got lice a few days ago from snowboarding. my mom has been helping me with the treatments for the past few days, putting the lice killing shampoo in my hair and combing out the lice with the special comb. and she has to go through the roots checking for lice and picking out anything that might look like lice or lice eggs, just combing for hours on end, and it totally reminded me of how monkeys groom their loved ones. like she would part my hair and look for any eggs buried in the roots then sometimes when the mother monkeys find smth they'll pick it out and eat it which is kinda nasty but that's what it reminded me of when my mom was combing through my hair. that's quite the image to imagine lol but i felt like my natural instincts just kicked in... it's a love language fr.`

today my mom made a comment about why i didn't make the video about our family, instead of the more anonymous vlog style that i'm doing now, and it kinda made me feel bad for a second but i don't think it's selfish to take on projects for yourself that are made in a way you like, and she probably didn't even mean it that way anyways. (edit: never mind she actually just meant it that way. smfh.) the reason i finally attempted to start this project is because we're hosting a gathering on new year's eve and my mom said some 叔叔 is going to be sharing his travel video to antarctica, so i was like what i want to share my video too. but i had to actually have the video first, so i made it.`

`there's a patch of mold growing on my carpet, right by my bed, in the corner next to the bedside cabinet. it started growing there when i spilled my water one night and i figured it wouldn't hurt to just leave some of it and let it evaporate, since it's just water and i was sleepy and wanted to go to bed. and it seemed to be fine for a few days, but then it started to smell wet, like mildew, right by where i lay down to sleep. so i've been spraying it with a mold n mildew remover, every day, like watering a plant. perhaps the liquid chemicals may just be causing it to mutate and become more hydrated, but it's become a part of my daily routine. i think i'm even starting to grow used to this patch of mold living in my carpet. like it's growing on me.`

`yesterday i went snowboarding for the first time and it was AMAZING and i took a lesson and met these two girls who i rode with the rest of the day and the snowboarding instructor looked like jacob from twilight. and basically after like 2 runs i had the hang of doing turns and controlling my speed down the mountain. i picked it up pretty fast because the mechanics are pretty similar to skating and i also skied before and it's literally just the combination of those two sports. i caught one nasty edge towards the end of the run and was very grateful for my helmet. 

speaking of the fucking helmet i literally got lice from it. bcs it was a rental and it was a size small so i probably got lice from some kid who wore the helmet before me T-T like merry christmas and fuck me. it was fine until last night and then my head starting itching like a lot and i woke up because of it at 4am and i literally was laying in bed like fuck i got lice from the snowboard rental helmet and i felt gross and was lowkey panicking about it but i was like it's 4am i need to go back to sleep and deal with this tomorrow morning. and alas the next morning i had lice TT. i'll do a treatment today but that stuff takes weeks to get rid of TT i got lice once when i was young and it is so persistent and annoying. euuurghhh `

`in high school i made a bunch of these clay octopuses with this design, like the head is just a ball and the legs were just 8 smaller balls. i really liked it because it was super simple to make and it stood really nicely, like it was just really satisfying to pick up and put down. my favorites were these tiny mini ones, smaller than a coin, and they would sit on top of each other like a snowman. i remember i originally made a set of 3, each one smaller than the other, but the largest one became overly dry and crumbled to pieces. it was made of air dry clay, so i guess it simply returned back to the earth. 
		
at some point i showed veda how to make them too, and we each made an octopus together. she had to leave before we were done painting, so she took it home to finish. but when i visited her house after school one day i accidentally saw her finished octopus on the shelf and it looked so busted i couldn't stop laughing. the rest of the paint job was done haphazardly with marker and for some reason it looked so sad, it was hilarious. `

i went to a christmas eve party today with my parents at their friend's house that i've never met before, and i was expecting to not know anybody but i actually ran into quite a few familiar faces and talked to ktlyn again for the first time in forever! it was really nice to catch up. and the food was good too :p`

`i went to visit harper today. i'm really glad i went. i was crying before we left, not even sure why. i should have been happy to be seeing her so soon but it just made me really sad. but when we showed up she ran out the front door to greet us and jumped up at our laps and her tail was wagging and it was adorable. 

i originally did not plan for it to be a whole family thing, i was fine with just going by myself. the lady emailed them and seemed to assume that everyone was going to come so my parents kind of just invited themselves. i honestly was not that thrilled about them coming, especially my dad. my dad was nothing if not unsupportive while harper was here. if he had been more supportive and actually helped my mom out with the dog while i was gone, she wouldn't even have had to leave. all he had to say about her while she was here were negative things. and i guess i'm glad he supported my mom with the process of finding harper a new home, but i honestly kind of can't stand it. i find his supportiveness more hypocritical than anything else. where was this attitude when harper was our dog? and even though i know my mom did a lot for the dog and loved her too and was probably even closer to her and definitely spent more time with her than i did, i guess i kind of just overall feel a bit of resentment towards them for giving away my dog. maybe for my parents it was somewhat of a relief, that they have one less thing to take care of and that much less stuff to worry about each day. but for me it just feels more like an act of betrayal. 

the lady was so nice though, she's just like a grandma and she showed us her and her husband's collectibles. she really loves loves harper, she brings her everywhere and harper follows her around and i'm sure she loves her too. she had so many new toys and she brought them all to show us and play with us. i got to look into harper's eyes and scratch her behind the ears and rub her chest and it felt just like before. i think she even got a little chunkier. i saw on her new dog tag it said ‘morgan' on it and i'm not sure if they're trying to give her a new name. but they didn't mention anything about it and when i called her harper she sat so well and looked up at me and gave me her attention just like always.

the lady's house looks like what i want my future home to look like, and i'm already well on my way. her daughter was there as well and was talking to my parents about her state jobs and to me about how she went to ucla for summer school one summer. she seemed to be very in tune with people, because she asked me if i was doing okay even though i thought i was doing pretty good. i didn't even cry like i thought i would. 

honestly walking away from that was not as bad as i thought it would be. i'm really glad i went. i think harper is in really good hands and i know she won't forget me and definitely doesn't blame us or anything like that. i don't even think she has the capacity to blame lol she's just a dog and a silly girl. i think i just need to move on and stop blaming my parents and i guess myself. harper will be happy and that's all that matters.`

i'm grieving her like she's dead but she's alive and well, don't worry. but i can't help but think that we didn't deserve her. like we betrayed her trust.

`i got high tonight for the first time in my life and i'm not gonna lie i'm still coming down from it a little bit and i haven't blogged in a hotttt minute so i thought now would be teh perfect time to do it i'm not going to go back adn fix my typos anymore after this it's going to be a very stream of consciousness type of blog. a high stream of consciousness high speed i feel like i can't stop my fingers from typing but they're also typing almost sluggishly slow. i'm not even looking at th keyboard just thinking. 

on the way back i was thinking i should write about this experience and i thought about my blog. anyways the experience i went with sun and CY and mandy to the food coop that yam lives and met all of yam's coop friends. and then we went to weho which is apparently a gay area in la and it was the weho block party on halloween !!! it's halloween btw happy halloween :)) i was waldo today adn it was so interesting being a recognizable hallloween character i haven't done that for a while. but omg. the experience

i got high for the first time after i took 2 big drags of CY's blunt and the first one is ok but the second one always hits more and i was choking bruh i was dying i have never choked before and that's how i knew. i was the last one to get high out of the girls and then once i got high it was crazy 0 i knew i was going to get high cus that choking was insane but i felt a lightness spread from my feet and in reality i probably just felt like i couldn't feel them that much anymore, but at the same time they tingle so it feels like you're floating a few feet above the ground. and i started swaying, feeling things zoom in on me almost... my surroundings blur... like a movie shot, but this is probably how movies portray how it's like being high because that's how it's like being high. i remember when i was just feeling it sun made me laugh and i LAUGHED like girl i laughed. and then when i was looking at them it felt like we were in a movie scene, with the lights of the bar behind them and everything. it was crazy

but yeah then it was just us 4 girls and we were high. and then it was quite busy but some lady brushes against me and then bumps me and then she was standing there looking lost, and then sun pulled her in and was like are you okay? like do you need help because there was a man with her and we couldn't tell if they were together. and she looked a little scared and confused like are you okay? are you okay? and CY was like is that man bothering you? and after a while we were like wait i'm not sure if maybe we're scaring her and she doesn't actually need this help so we let her go. but we had like fully pulled her in to the circle. and then mandy, high slow blinking mandy was like i feel like she's pickpocketing adn i felt the emptiness in my pocket and i RAN and apparently i sprinted after her because i remember running FAR and sun being right behind me, but reflecting back  adn recounting back on that story i feel like those fast 2 seconds were a BLUR. i remember following where the gaps of people were the thinnest and that's where she was, because she was kind of running away from us. and then mandy and CY find this man dressed as a cop and he was holding my phone up in the air as if he had found it on the ground. and mandy's like wait you're sure that she took it, like that's insane. no wait i skipped but but i actually caught the woman and me and sun were like searching her pockets. fo ra second i felt bad, i was like we're chasing this poor woman down teh street. but i'm actually so disappointed that thieves work with women. mor more like cus i realized it's a stereotype that thieves are men adn it's actually a harmful stereotype because also because we're so trusting of women that we wouldn't even think about them being thieves. like that's crazy and the man was dressed as a cop and i literally fully thought h was a cup for a hot minute. prolly also cus i was high LMAO. but the high is prefect like i WANT TO SLEEP SO BAD bu i'm making myself stay up to type about this crazy sensation aid hope you read to the end. because i'm owing this for you. 

i also need waterrrr omfg water but yeah omg so he was holding it as if he found it and literally was acing to be hot e phone lowkey they were so professional  adn i was trying to point teh woman out to him as if he was the cops and he was gonna arrest her TT being high is soooo sill tt thought i only felt super giggly that one time at the beginning but after that moment ig it ‘sobered me up' like i'm still not sober but i didn't feel giggly no more after that. i was like my mom literally warned me about this cus she's warned me about her friends' sons getting their phones pickpocketed at the concert and i'm like omfg aw sun just called me to make sure i got home safe. i love themmmm but yes no it was crazy i got my phone back bu whew ere talking about it afterward sand trying to recount exactly how it happened like they were like can i try to pickpocket you lmfaooo but we did a play by play and bro lowkey it would have been so embarrassing if they stol our phones cus we were literally warned  about this before but then we went and GOT IT BACK like and we didn't even do it so it was like heroic and also we don't loook naive because teh only reason we were able to get them back adctually a combination of a lot of reasons si cus of sun's kindness first of all like literally pulling her in and we were so focused on making sure she was okay and that she was sAFE like we were protecting women TT and then afterwards mandy's high suspicion ‘i think she was pickpocketing' and then my fast reflexes LMFAO i was like sprinted off and grabbed her and CY was also there and ok honestly my critical thinking brain wasn't working that well and like still isn't but when we put the story together... like damnnnn omfg and then afterwards we were sooo vigilante with our phones like holding them and if ANYONE bumped us we were checking our pockets TT like omfg and also idk what i'm going to do about my work lmofa lowkey lmao but it's ok and i just want to go to sleep. it was so cold tonight we were all huddled up but linked arm in arm and it felt so nice :) it was like i literally warm and on the uber back i fell asleep on CY's shoulder i was literally considering not going to this event cus i was tired and i'm really really glad i went. `

we went to harajuku !! today and i LOVED it i could live there. but not for very long bcs i would literally run out of money and starve to death. 

i bought sooo many trinkets, some for myself and some for friends and i spent too many hours at the gachapon shops bcs i should've been looking for fashion but i could shop gachapon for days. i only brought three shirts

to japan bcs i was thinking to shop for clothing while i'm here but at this rate i'm just doing laundry. lol. 

i bought my first tamagotchi retail for way less than it sells in the us. i actually didn't play with these as a kid, i'm unfortunately a tiny bit too young even for that. and also too broke? i had a very broke, penniless childhood. 

i also went to the pig cafe at takeshita street TT they're were so damn adorable. they're fuzzy but not soft and when they go on your lap they immediately go to sleep and smack their lips like they're chewing on something. at first the pigs didn't want me; they kept running away. the workers had to keep bringing me pigs until one of them decided to stay

it was a little black micropig that got into a squeal fight with another little pink guy. and the worker picked him up and scolded him a little and then gave him to pigless me. and he stayed in my lap and went to sleep and i knew he would stay and i immediately loved him. or her. i honestly don't care. 

once one pig chooses you all the other pigs want to stay with you. i had 5 pigs on my lap at one point. apparently pigs have a herd mentality. they come and go but the little black pig stayed until the very end, she was my final girl. 

right when i was getting comfortable my reservation time was over and i had to leave. it's so interesting, that business, at the beginning they give you pigs and then at the end they take them away.`

`today i found a half decomposed lizard tail on the ground while i was picking up dog poop in the yard. i considered letting it decompose naturally a bit more before picking it up but i was afraid it might decompose too much and become brittle or fall apart if i let it stay out in the sun too much longer. i soaked it in warm water to soften the connective tissues remaining on the bone but it kind of softened it too much and now some of the tail bones are barely hanging on and one of the tail vertebrae fully came off :,(

i need to spend more time in the backyard though. i used to see entire worlds in there, and spend entire afternoons just exploring and finding interesting things in the garden. so many creatures have lived and died there; they've been there all this time, even when i stopped noticing. if i'm observant and a bit lucky, once nature takes its pickings, i sometimes get to keep a little piece for myself too`

`hiii today was lowkey a peak day it was productive, vibey and chill but also out of the ordinary because i found my lizard and i also prepared for my upcoming college workshop (which i'm leading), packed for japan (!!!) and drew my dog >.< i showed it to my mom and she said it looked really like her and actually the drawings look kind of funky but i honestly think that's just because my dog just looks kind of funky in the first place. so i think they look pretty true to the reference.`

`omg guys i found another lizard today while i was walking my dog i decided to go a bit further than we usually go and it was in the middle of the sidewalk covered with ants. and i stared at it for a while and i decided i wanted it so i picked it up with a poopy bag and all the ants went crazy and scattered and a few of them stayed on the lizard . 

i pick up alive lizards all the time and it feels pretty much the same, maybe even a little scarier because their movements are little a less predictable. the last one i got was already all dried out when i found it but this one was still flexible and soft. fresh. it felt just like it was alive. 

i cleaned the lizard in the sink and i had to flush so many ants down the drain. i felt so bad, i don't mind ants, i kind of admire them they're hardworking little guys and they are incredible creatures in their own right but i washed them down the sink because they were unfortunate enough to be crawling around on my lizard. 

at first the idea of it being dead freaked me out, maybe i have a kind of superstition that death isn't an absence of something but a presence, and by bringing those lizards back i was bringing death into my home. but at the end of the day we're all just organic matter and when we die we return to organic matter unless someone picks you up off the sidewalk and preserves the memory of your skin from the ants`

`i watched this video about ‘opportunity cost of your 20's' where you feel like everything you do comes at the trade off of another thing - been there - and also you feel like you have to monetize everything you do, was a marginal kind of side topic in that video, or you feel like everything you spend time on has to be the most profitable or monetizable choice. but i think through this experience, and just in general, i've been fortunate to learn that that's really not true - i'm going into my 20's soon and i hope i can learn this early and not struggle with this throughout my 20's, this feeling that everything i do should be for profit, working endlessly towards a corporate-provided narrative. ykwim? 

but yeah. i don't think, at least for now, i will become a person who makes money off their artwork - i would love to someday own a small business though and i can't imagine myself doing it at this point for anything except art or something that i produce with my own two hands so we'll see if i ever actually have the urge for that. but i think that's what the 20's is for, trying and failing to have a small business and becoming disillusioned with monetizing your hobbies and selling your art. but anyways i wonder if my conclusion about finding happiness in having a corporate job and requisitioning my hobbies to just be side pursuits is like selling out, and maybe it's not authentic enough . like i am sidelining my authenticity to only when i'm not selling out to labor for corporate over my 9-5.

i might end up posting some stuff like this on my blog. i've been really inspired by non-edited youtube videos, where people just post unedited videos of themselves talking or whatever and i'm not brave enough to do that. but maybe i will post unedited writings onto my blog, when i make it, because i kinda hate editing my writing anyways and when i edit i feel that i sometimes over-edit it and write over my own voice. somehow, even though i'm the one editing. this is kind of raw though... although nobody's going to be reading my blog honestly as far as i'm concerned`,

`remember when you used to go to the cafeteria and look at the lunch menu options and if they had one of the good ones it would make your day? we used to line up for the bosco sticks, and the chicken tenders, if they were served with tater tots, and in my opinion the pizza was good sometimes too. and there was always the crustables pb&j but sometimes it was served cold. maybe it was the lunch ladies way of taking revenge.`

`when we were small my friend and i used to hide out in a little bathroom cabinet, under the sink. we would crawl in there through the cabinet door, one at a time, and curl in our legs so that we could both fit. sometimes we brought the bunnies in too, and then we would just sit, facing each other. sometimes we talked quietly, or napped, or sat in silence, or whispered about how if the clowns ever came while we were here, they would never find us. 

i used to think my parents didn't know about our secret little hideout. i used to go in there by myself sometimes, too. when i wanted somewhere to escape, or somewhere to feel like it was just me and nothing else. just to get away. `
