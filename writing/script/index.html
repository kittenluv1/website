	<p>POLICE: 9-1-1, what’s your emergency?</p>

	<p>WOMAN: *static fumbling noises, then the call clears* I just killed a man.</p>

	<p>P: What’s your name, ma’am?</p>

	<p>W: Helen.</p>

	<p>P: Okay Helen, now please don’t do anything rash, can you tell me where you are?</p>

	<p>W: I’m at 214 Paris St.</p>

	<p>P: Helen, is it safe for you to stay there?</p>

	<p>W: Yes, this is my house.</p>

	<p>P: Okay Helen, go ahead and take a seat and take a breath, we’ll send people to help you right away.</p>

	<p>W …</p>

	<p>P: Helen?</p>

	<p>W: … Well, okay.</p>

	<p>P: Stay on the line now, could you please tell me what happened there?</p>

	<p>W: Well I was in my house. And he came into my house. And now he’s bleeding all over my new linoleum tiles.</p>

	<p>P: And how did he end up bleeding… all over your tiles?</p>

	<p>W: Hit to the back of the head. Blunt force trauma.</p>

	<p>P: Do you know if he’s still breathing, Helen?</p>

	<p>W: Well, I don’t know, I didn’t exactly get a chance to check for a pulse. But it looks pretty damn traumatic to me.</p>

	<p>P: And were you the one who delivered the blow to his head, Helen?</p>

	<p>W: Well, yeah.</p>

	<p>P: What did you hit him with?</p>

	<p>W: Oh, it was my ex-husband’s baseball bat. Pretty solid little slugger… could be straight from Louisville.</p>

	<p>P: And how many times was he hit upside the head, ma’am?</p>

	<p>W: *surprised* I only hit him once…. Should I do more?</p>

	<p>P: No, that won’t be necessary. Could you tell me where in the head area he was hit, ma’am?</p>

	<p>W: Oh, sure… looks like it’s right up into the occipital. He won’t be seeing God anytime soon.</p>

	<p>P: Thank you ma’am. If you’re comfortable with it… would you mind describing the depth of the damage?</p>

	<p>W: Why, the bat’s not damaged at all.</p>

	<p>P: Right… *he hears the sirens wailing through the women’s end of the line* now ma’am please stay calm and stay right where you are… we’ve got people coming to help you right away.</p>

	<p>W: Oh, alright. Please tell them to do it thoroughly, I would really appreciate it. *heard more and more distantly, like she’s put down the phone* My tiles…</p>
