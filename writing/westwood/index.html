		<h1>Breaking! Woman Takes Accountability</h1>
		<p>A local woman was reported ‘taking accountability for her actions’, according to recent witnesses at the event. Opinions regarding the troubling news are split:</p>
		<p>‘It’s in the Bible, y’know. Ever since the fall of Eden,’ testifies Peter Iscariot, as he hits the Juul his buddy gifted him for their 4th man-versary. ‘Eve is the one who gave the apple to Adam, introducing original sin,’ he mansplains.</p>
		<p>‘I don’t believe it,’ says Ralph Amale (M, 28). ‘Next thing you know, they’re going to try to tell us that females are human beings too’. When it was pointed out that a man was arguably the one at fault in the scenario, Amale, with a condescending smirk, countered with a brilliant observation, ‘Well, who do you think raised him?’</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, the woman in question was not given a chance to speak for herself regarding the matter. At press time, she was seen being aware of her surroundings and having an actual hobby. </p>
