		<hr>
		<p>As Sresor Gamga awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic door. He was propped in a spacious, ornate wood frame, with large, perpendicular stiles and a low-hanging sill. In his present new condition, Sresor contemplated how he was to get to work. His father came down to bang on his door to find out why he had not yet gone to work, only to find that Sresor could not make it to work, because he had recently transformed into said door. For a brief moment, Sresor thought to himself that the whole situation may be a bit ridiculous, even hinging on the absurd. But no sooner did the idea cross his mind did he allow it to pass through, and reminded himself to put a handle on the situation, so he could quickly resume business as usual.</p>
		<p>His mother was distraught, his father furious. Sresor’s family did not know what to do with him - they could not even simply close the door and rid themselves of his presence, as they may have done if he had turned into, say, a giant bug. “If only he could talk,” they whispered behind closed doors - other doors - but in Sresor’s replies they heard only squeaky hinges and the slamming of wood. </p>
		<p>As the months passed, Sresor grew accustomed to the liminal state of his new condition. His sister would occasionally come to check on him, and she in her ever-loving generosity and care always did him the favor of leaving him open, or just slightly ajar. With experimentation, Sresor found that he could more freely move his door parts, flexing his tarnished hinges to bring his body open and closed. To pass the time, he was fond of casually swinging back and forth, back and forth, and he found his thoughts gradually becoming attuned to his new physical form - he yearned to separate the rich from the poor, the enlightened from the ignorant, the king from his subject, the country man from his admittance. Sresor soon learned that he quite enjoyed the feeling of freedom he gained from spending his time mindlessly opening, and, to the horror of his family, slamming repeatedly shut. </p>
		<p>As the family felt the effects of Sresor’s metamorphosis, Sresor discovered that they actually could work after all, and not only that, they had harbored a sum from his indebtitude for emergency exits in times such as these. They began to lodge the three close-minded travelers, in whose presence Gamga was to stay firmly and quietly shut, and in their stay he felt his hinges begin to rust and his stiles beginning to fuse with the surrounding frame. </p>
		<p>That night, Sresor’s sister, bless her blossoming young heart, decided to play. On her opening note, Gamga heard the heavenly choir; by her closing chord, he saw their future. In his vision, he would guard her and lock her behind his sturdy body, protect her with his life, never to unlock for any person. For his sister, Sresor was ready to become idle, a nonfunctional door, a door with no purpose, which in practice becomes no longer a door but rather a decoration, a lifeless partition, an inanimate wall. </p>
		<p>“I think it’s time we open new doors,” Gamga heard his sister suggest. “We must find our closure - my brother is gone, and we must rid ourselves of the notion that my brother is this door, for if it truly was my brother, he surely would have installed himself somewhere else to inhibit another family by now”. And his parents agreed, and Gamga did too. </p>
		<p>Gamga thought of his family with firm love and adoration. In his last dying breaths he came to understand that a door’s death is not in misuse, but in disuse. As he surrendered himself to death’s door, Sresor’s casing, already rotting and decomposing on the edges, fused itself to Sresor’s wooden stiles, conjoining into a solidified and unmovable force. </p>
