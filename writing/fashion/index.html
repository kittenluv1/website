		<p>Fashion is for girls. Here’s why that couldn’t be more true.</p>
		<p>Fashion’s associations with the feminine and superficial are no coincidence - our tendency to dismiss it as an idle pastime obscures how women have wielded it as a means to express and to subvert. From the controversial corset to the modern pantsuit, women’s clothing has mirrored and shaped the experience of its wearers. Diving into women’s tumultuous relationship with fashion and the conflicting connotations that contribute to its notoriety reveals the power of fashion to disrupt, protect, untangle, and empower.</p>

		<h2>Part 1 - In The Beginning: Trivializing Fashion</h2>
		<p>Fashion began as a male-dominated field. Until the late 18th century, aristocratic men dictated fashion styles as an engine to flaunt their wealth. Then in 1792, the publication of Mary Wollestonecraft’s seminal A Vindication of the Rights of Woman spurred discussions about traditional gender roles and expectations, sparking the first ripples of feminism. In response, men rejected fashion altogether in an event known as the Great Male Renunciation. Leaving their status as fashion icons in the past, men ditched their voluminous breeches and colorful petticoats for neutral tones and sleek silhouettes, abandoning ‘their claim to be considered <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3527211" target="_blank">beautiful</a>’ to their female counterparts.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>While the Renunciation was focused on fashion, it also reflected broader social and cultural trends. A changing standard for masculinity <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21151350" target="_blank">rebranded</a> men as rational and practical, in contrast to portrayals of women as frivolous and emotional. This harmful trope has been weaponized to diminish women to a status of inferiority under the sensible male hand. As men aimed to differentiate themselves from women through their styles of dress and shiny new gender-based virtues, this rhetoric stitched together fashion, frivolity, and femininity in a tight association which still manifests to this day.</p>

		<h2>Part 2 - Ideological Friction and Physical Restriction</h2>
		<p>By the mid-19th century, women were growing weary of their domestic prisons. The corset’s binding functions literally restricted women’s ability to move and work; as first wave feminists like Amelia Bloomer and Elizabeth Cady Stanton pressed for equality and workplace rights, the suffocating corset became an emblem of women’s oppression. A growing body of scholarship dedicated specifically to the corset highlights the conflicting narratives surrounding the piece. Corsets were restrictive but also supportive; by binding but also highlighting the inherently sexual female figure, they symbolized chastity and also suggestivity.</p>
		<p>The 1850’s to 1870’s saw the gradual replacement of the corset with less restrictive undergarments, including Susan T. Converse’s “emancipation suit”. As women traded tight-laced corsets for more breathable one-pieces, widespread panic about women’s penetration into men’s fashions created fears about the imminent downfall of man. Feminists’ radical embrace of comfort and leg mobility through their adoption of loose-fitting bloomers became a negative point of contention, which opponents seized upon in order to vilify and de-feminize.</p>

		<p>To refocus attention back to the core values of the movement, suffragists were forced to return to more traditional long skirts and dresses. In this way, gender structures were upheld by purposeful attempts to constrain women to ‘feminine’ styles of dress, which physically confined women’s bodies in functionally prohibitive clothing, and also socially cemented them safely within the confines of their established roles. </p>

		<h2>Part 3 - Finding Empowerment in a Confined Clothing Norm</h2>
		<p>Later 20th century feminism reclaimed the power of normative fashion as a means of empowerment. Though these women advocated for legal rights including workplace equality, sexual liberation, and reproductive autonomy, their activism was often criticized for its white, middle-class ideals, which failed to include the intersecting struggles of BIPOC and working class women.</p>
		<p>Despite this, <a href="https://women.ca.gov/women-of-color-and-the-fight-for-womens-suffrage/" target="_blank">women of color</a>, queer feminists, and other minoritized groups created important spaces to pursue intersectional struggles for female autonomy. Donning neat button-ups and modest A-line skirts, these women brought their “<a href="https://wwd.com/feature/protest-fashion-black-civil-rights-black-panthers-blm-1234715312/?sub_action=logged_in" target="_blank">Sunday Best</a>” to nonviolent demonstrations. Black women of the civil rights movement had to fight to be accepted as people first, and then women. Wielding the dignity embodied by their ‘proper and ladylike’ attire, these women wore their clothing as an ideological shield to protect and strengthen them against racial injustice and violence.</p>

		<h2>Part 4 - Rejecting Femininity</h2>
		<p>While second wave feminists advocated for sexual liberation, they also actively opposed lesbian and gay sexual identities, leading to the creation of lesbian feminist separatist groups such as the <a href="https://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/lesbians-20th-century/lesbian-feminism" target="_blank">Radicalesbians</a>. These groups embraced an androgynous style in an outright rejection of the male gaze. Aiming for ‘undesirability’, lesbian feminists adopted a recognizable ‘<a href="https://dressingdykes.com/2021/07/30/lesbian-feminist-dress-codes/" target="_blank">uniform</a>’ consisting of short hair, straight-legged jeans, baggy work shirts, bare faces, and unshaven legs. By defying the conventions of femininity, lesbian feminists created a standard-resisting fashion subspace tailored exclusively to the female gaze.</p>
		<p>In a similar way, some feminists of the 1960’s and 70’s openly rejected fashion, citing its regressiveness as a binding construction of a materialistic, objectifying femininity. Inspired by Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique, feminists of this era <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/powerful-complicated-legacy-betty-friedans-feminine-mystique-180976931/" target="_blank">criticized</a> the ways in which women were tamed and domesticated by predatory advertising, leading to their commodification as objects of female consumerism. During an infamous march against the Miss America Beauty Pageant, women discarded lipstick, high heels, and even undergarments in a symbolic rebellion against the objects which suppressed female autonomy. </p>

		<p>Similar to the suffragists’ earlier rejection of the corset, second wave feminists aimed to dismantle the material barriers to women’s liberation. However, comparable to the controversy incited by female bloomers over a century earlier, these ‘bra-burning feminists’ were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45303069" target="_blank">mythicized</a> and radicalized by the media to divert from the movement’s real goals. In the end, the second wave era was unfortunately misconstrued to reinforce the correlation between femininity and artificiality, with connotations of materialism and deceit. </p>

		<h2>Part 5 - The Case of the Controversial 80’s Pantsuit</h2>
		<p>The integration of the pantsuit into the working woman’s closet elevated women to coexist in ‘masculine’ settings. However, it did so without challenging any of the existing rhetorics surrounding what kinds of shapes and bodies were welcomed in those spaces to begin with. Troubling industry trends reflect this assessment today: despite accounting for over two-thirds of all spending in the fashion industry, women represent only <a href="https://www.notjustalabel.com/editorial/gender-gap-why-do-men-still-rule-fashion-world" target="_blank"> 14%</a> of major executive positions. A dual symbol of women’s increased mobility within executive spheres, and the lack of proportional increase in female authority, the pantsuit acted as a ladder to the metaphorical glass ceiling, allowing women to enter the glass runway without shattering any of the structures which held it up. </p>
		<p>Since their break into the fashion industry in the <a href="https://hissup.com/fashion-history/the-history-of-the-fashion-industry/" target="_blank">1940’s</a>, however, women have been reclaiming the agency to their own consumption. In the ‘80s, the first wave of fashion environmentalism was led by female <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/female-designers-fashion-revolution-vogue-august-2019-issue" target="_blank">designers</a> including Eileen Fisher and Katharine Hamnett, and feminist designers like <a href="https://onpost.shop/blogs/blog/the-feminist-movement-in-the-fashion-industry" target="_blank">Vivienne Westwood</a> employ feminist principles to express of feminine strength through clothing. New wave feminists continue to push for greater acceptance within the ideal of femininity, including movements towards the acceptance of natural hair, inclusion of all bodies, and the reevaluation and breakdown of gender binaries entirely. </p>

		<h2>Part 6 - This Is Not The End</h2>
		<p>Fashion is art worn on the body: like food, culture, and literature, it is an intimate form of expression and sustenance grounded in practice by real bodies and tangible systems. Fashion speaks directly to society’s treatment of the individuals that wear it, make it, endorse it, and disdain it. </p>
		<p>Due to its dismissal as a matter of materialistic frivolity, fashion has not received the serious considerations for social mobility and critical <a href="https://blog.apaonline.org/2020/01/15/fashion-and-philosophy/" target="_blank">study</a> that it deserves. Yet the history of fashion is as complex and ubiquitous as religion, food, war, or politics. In the 18th century, the fashion binary was created by men to uphold patriarchal structures which reduced women to objects of mere appearances. Since then, the binary has been challenged and reformed, questioned and reinstated, completely rejected, and challenged again. Women’s renouncement of constricting corsets caused dramatic pushback, compelling feminists to search for threads of empowerment within the norms of traditional femininity. Other forms of fashionable feminism have ranged from embracing masculine patterns like the business pantsuit, to rejecting the construct of fashion and femininity as a whole. </p>
		<p>Despite its complex history, fashion has and will continue to be a powerful vehicle for female empowerment. The variety seen in women’s fashion today is a testament to the ever-adapting resilience of the female narrative and the feminist pursuit to break out of every box that tries to contain it. Modern fashion continues to enable agency - the agency of choice, to participate, or not participate, in the most immediate outward forms of expression that construct our narratives. In order to wield the weapon of fashion, it’s time we recognize its unique ability to shape our futures for good (and girls). </p>
