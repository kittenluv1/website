The year is 9999 AD. The utopia is run as a true democracy: every month, questions are raised and discussed in a public debate-style forum at the community square. Concerns from citizens are written down and reviewed by government officials in time for the next month&rsquo;s convention. Prompts from the government and citizens are resolved at these forums through majority-rules voting. Although attendance is encouraged, these meetings are entirely optional.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haven&rsquo;s key industries include farming, medicine, education, law enforcement, and government. Farmers provide the society with all its raw materials, such as corn, rice, and cotton. Doctors treat illness and other medical needs of the people. Teachers, principals, and other staff run schools and educate the people. Law enforcement, as stated in the name, enforces the law. This includes indicting criminals and carrying out punishment of crimes. Governmental leaders have final say in the making and passing laws, and resource allocation. In Haven, the contribution of each and every citizen is essential. Every person must do their fair share of work towards the utopia. Within each industry, shares of work are allocated based on supply and demand; for example, if a person chooses to be a farmer, they may be required to harvest one field of rice per day in order to fulfill their share for the community. Citizens may choose in which trade to work, unless an industry finds itself in a shortage of workers. In this case, volunteers will be requested to fill up the missing positions. If there are not enough volunteers, workers may be drafted. All resources produced and harvested are collected and redistributed equally by the government.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">History of Haven</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">By 9000, climate change has killed almost all life through flooding, wildfires, and habitat destruction. The ice caps have melted, pollution litters almost every visible surface, and the air and water are poisonous with toxic chemicals. The hundred-thousand people still alive were gathered by the founders of Haven and assembled into a community on the last fertile piece of land on earth. The society is enclosed within a sturdy mesh glass, which is surrounded by a large, insurmountable wall three miles away. Citizens are not allowed past the glass barrier, for the benefit of them and the earth. Being united in a single place and purpose, the human race will no longer face extermination, and while the human population recovers in Haven, the Earth will begin her own recovery, reclaiming what belongs to her. The utopia will continue to exist until the planet has completely recovered from human activity&rsquo;s harmful effects. Due to the nature of how the utopia came to be, all energy used to run Haven is sourced sustainably from sunlight and the environment. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">In the interim, Haven leaders developed a system of government centered around the fact that everything and everyone is equal. Keeping in mind what caused the devastation leading up to that point, the leaders also abolished the idea of money and wealth. In the new system of government, all people are held in equal esteem, and therefore are given and expected to give back equally. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">No information is withheld from citizens: from childhood, they are taught in schools about earth&rsquo;s history, and how Haven came to be. They are informed on topics such as internal affairs, and the state of the earth. Citizens are expected to use this knowledge responsibly by participating and contributing to society.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haven Beliefs</span></p><ol class="c12 lst-kix_jce4qym1zye4-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Everyone is equal. The most basic and important value of Haven is that everyone is equal. Regardless of race, age, gender, ability, and any other traits that separate people, all citizens of Haven are held as equals in all aspects. When everyone treats and respects each other as peers, Haven is a true utopia.</span></li><li class="c0 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Respect the environment. As we have experienced, pollution of all kinds is devastating to the environment. Haven is a utopia formed after the desolation of the earth due to this exact cause, and does not intend to continue contributing to it. Citizens are expected to throw their trash away, recycle, and reuse. Companies must find sustainable sources for electricity.</span></li><li class="c0 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Greed is equal to ignorance. It is common knowledge within the citizens that greed was one of the main causes of humankind&rsquo;s downfall. Internal fighting and selfishness, regardless of harmful externalities, killed the planet. Greed and discontentment do not have a place in a society where everyone must work together just to survive.</span></li><li class="c0 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">The best way to give back to Haven is by contributing to it. Attending and engaging in discussions at monthly forums is recommended for those who wish to see change. Volunteer work to help those in need is applauded. Together with following all laws and being a part of the workforce, citizens can directly contribute to the harmony and function of the society. </span></li><li class="c0 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Be kind. Showing kindness warrants kindness in return. Hostility towards other citizens, no matter for what reason, is extremely looked down upon. The citizens of Haven must learn from the past, and be willing to be the better people for the good of the world.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></li></ol><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Haven Laws</span></p><ol class="c12 lst-kix_ibhozhjc4gdt-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Resource Allocation Law. The government distributes equal resources to every person in the utopia. The resources include anything and everything citizens need to lead a comfortable life: food, water, clothing, shelter, electricity, et cetera. </span></li><li class="c0 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Thievery, Assault, and Murder. Any crimes involving the harm or stealing of another person or their property are absolutely not accepted. Our utopia relies on the harmony of our population and equity of our resources, and felonies disrupting this peace are not tolerated.</span></li><li class="c0 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Mandatory Participation in the Economy Law. For the purpose of having enough resources to sustain a generous lifestyle for all, everyone in the utopia must contribute their fair share to the society. For those with a disadvantage that disables them from working, a friend or family member may volunteer to take on their share. If this is not an option and someone is incapable of contributing to the society, they will not be provided resources by the government. </span></li><li class="c0 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Illegal Items and Contraband. All items owned that were not given by the government are considered contraband. The use of contraband to improve wealth and cause disparity is also prohibited under this law.</span></li><li class="c0 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Release as a Result of Unlawful Behavior. Any violation of any of the laws stated above results in expulsion from the community. Offenders will be released from our Haven, past the second wall, and may not be allowed within eyesight of the border. </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></li></ol><p class="c2"><span class="c1">System of Government</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Government</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In charge of reviewing complaints from community meetings, ratification of laws, resource allocation, and ensuring the well-being of the utopia. All government officials are elected by the people once every five years, and have the same amount of power and responsibility.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c8">&darr;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Industry Leaders</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elected by their peers in the same industry for benevolence, their job is to give insight to lawmakers to help create better laws specific to certain industries, and they may have a role in running their industry.
