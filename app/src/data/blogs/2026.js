    content: `i write really personal things in my blogs and try to keep things authentic and raw and only a little bit fictional. sometimes i would start typing a title into the code editor, and then copilot would immediately spit out an entire blog about whatever topic it thought i was going for. and the scary thing is that it kind of sounded like... me. like i would write that. probably did write that. i really don't like how that feels, hearing my own internal monologue mimicked back to me by my computer... an imperfect imitation, but always learning. that shit was so scary i had to turn it off. `,

    content: `- the best way to become a better lover is to practice being a great friend
- you can fall in love with anyone. everyone is an artist. everyone's life is a story
- if you only date supermodels, it's more of a reflection on your insecurity than anything
- chocolate covered strawberries are naturally romantic. try to incorporate them into your regular diet
- what is unconditional love? would you love me if i was a worm? would you love me if i was a boy? 
- you can't just ask to unfumble the bag, you gotta do it
- wait, please, you're the only girl who's ever given me love and affection... i've never been at peace with myself, even after i met you... you're the love of my life, i need you because you make me feel like more of a man than i ever will be... i have to have you in order to have me. you're <b>everything</b> to me. 
- why does nobody want to see me undressed? you can't even let your guard down when you're clothed!
- love is morbid!!!

happy valentine's day, xoxoxo`,

    content: `i feel insane i'm going crazy with anticipation... i spent today in agony waiting for a response. is this how people feel when they're in love? i think i'm coming down with something, i've literally been worrying myself sick. last night i had a dream, that i was in a family of fish and we were fleeing for our lives again. and then we had big black wings, and we were searching the sky and the sea... flying above the sea water, skimming the salty waves with our feet. feeling powerless but free. 

why does hope make people miserable? i don't know but man, i guess it's up to fate again. if it's meant to be yours it will be yours. and things come looking for you when you're not looking for them. ah i've made peace with my results... whatever they may be, i know i tried. i was fine before and i'll be fine after. you know, i just got invited to my friend's wedding... how can i change what's truly not within my control?`,

    content: `i just finished my pinterest oa! i was so excited when i got the email, it's literally for my dream position out of all the 120 positions that i applied for this year and last year, this is the one that i wanted the MOST... but i was also immediately stressed because i haven't been grinding leetcode like that because i honestly wasn't expecting much from the places that still haven't gotten back to me at this point. so imagine my surprise...

this past week i've kind of just been a non-person though, existing solely to master data structures and algorithms. the week before that i was also a non-person, but at least what i was hyperfocused on was slightly more personal - i did a lot of work on my website and portfolio :) my schoolwork and other work is feeling extremely neglected rn. but i finally finished the oa this morning, i literally couldn't sleep last night because i was so nervous (excited!) to do it today, and i did super okay on it. like i got a pretty average score ToT. i really hope it's enough, but at this point i've done my part and what happens next is up not to me... so if you're my pinterest recruiter reading this, hiii (pls give me an interview (つ╥﹏╥)つ.·°՞)

    content: `i just really wanted to go to the beach, and i had also wanted to do goth again sometime, so i decided why not just do both... right now? and the upcoming weekend was a long weekend. it was the perfect opportunity. i entertained some plans of going to the beach and watching the sunset, taste-tested adding makeup and a book and an edible to that plan, and it was sounding really delicious. and after thinking about it some more while trying to fall asleep that night, i decided to make it official and added it to my calendar. i originally contemplated doing it alone - spending some time with my thoughts and being emo and vulnerable and sentimental with myself. but i decided to ask my best friend if they were down and just go regardless of whether they were able to join or not. and i was glad i went with them. and that they were down to do it with me. it made it feel like a sisters goth beach night out. which is funny bcs a guy on the elevator did ask us if we were nuns ToT

i had a super productive and relaxed and nice long weekend. looking back, i caught up on all my lectures, reading, and work from the last week and even made a tiny bit of progress on this week's. i took professional pictures and did my interview and watched a really good movie and skated. jennifer's body is a really good movie btw. and i cleaned out and reorganized all the files on my computer, so i'm one step closer to that computer refresh or os switch, but i don't want to be too much in a rush for that to happen. maybe i'll spend more time on linux for my os class this qtr and see if i like it enough to try it as a full time os. i want to do a lot of things again, but if i time it right, i just might get around to actually doing some of them... `,

i remember in high school my ap literature teacher told one of my classmates that i had a strong voice in my writing, and it left a strong impression on me. i really liked his class and i even wrote him a card at the end of the year, saying how i learned a lot from him and that his class inspired me to want to write a book. now i'm not so sure if that's going to happen... maybe after i retire... but i wonder if he would even be alive by then and if he was, if he would read it. i was always a good student but not a favorite. never really liked talking to the teachers, but i got good grades and did the homework. 
    
i learned recently about a rumor that that teacher had inappropriate relations with one of my friends that was in his class with me... the same one that he talked about my writing to in fact... and that she went to his house to do ... ? it really shocked me but at the same time... i'm disappointed but not surprised. there was a lot of incidents like that at at my high school. i see you've also read lolita... and your playground is the classroom...`,

think less, do more: there will never be a time when you're completely free... you will always have to make time. 
appreciate the importance of doing nothing, too

some things i did to welcome in the new year: 
- took a nap on the couch
- dyed my hair >.<
- looked into linuxOS (perhaps this is the year i become a linux user)
- bought a new domain for my site! (bunnyluv1 - i plan to try it out and kittenluv1 and just see which one sticks)

***

planning a major site refactor that involves moving everything to a framework, so a lot of things might go under construction for a while. this is good for the long term growth and scalability of my website... i think, according to my research (i asked chatgpt)

i noticed that my ‘new year's resolutions' from last year to this year haven't really changed much. i could take it as a sign of stagnation, that i'm not growing or challenging myself enough, but i kind of would rather see it as an indication of stability, like i've found goals for myself that i can continue to aim for even past the arbitrary term of one year. or perhaps in other words, new year, same me :p it's nice, not having to reinvent myself every year. also bcs i didn't fulfill my resolution of landing a kf last year (╥ᴗ╥) this is the year tho, i can feel it... `,
