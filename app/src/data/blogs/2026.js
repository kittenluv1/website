    content: `i just really wanted to go to the beach, and i had also wanted to do goth again sometime, so i decided why not just do both... right now? and the upcoming weekend was a long weekend. it was the perfect opportunity. i entertained some plans of going to the beach and watching the sunset, taste-tested adding makeup and a book and an edible to that plan, and it was sounding really delicious. and after thinking about it some more while trying to fall asleep that night, i decided to make it official and added it to my calendar. i originally contemplated doing it alone - spending some time with my thoughts and being emo and vulnerable and sentimental with myself. but i decided to ask my best friend if they were down and just go regardless of whether they were able to join or not. and i was glad i went with them. and that they were down to do it with me. it made it feel like a sisters goth beach night out. which is funny bcs a guy on the elevator did ask us if we were nuns ToT

i had a super productive and relaxed and nice long weekend. looking back, i caught up on all my lectures, reading, and work from the last week and even made a tiny bit of progress on this week's. i took professional pictures and did my interview and watched a really good movie and skated. jennifer's body is a really good movie btw. and i cleaned out and reorganized all the files on my computer, so i'm one step closer to that computer refresh or os switch, but i don't want to be too much in a rush for that to happen. maybe i'll spend more time on linux for my os class this qtr and see if i like it enough to try it as a full time os. i want to do a lot of things again, but if i time it right, i just might get around to actually doing some of them... `,

    content: `i was sitting in class and it was freezing so i went to sit outside in the sun and it was hot, so i moved to a spot on the bench in the shade and it was cold... it was kind of ridiculous, i felt like goldilocks. but it's kind of nice that it's both hot and cold, because the sun is so glorious and nice... i could never live somewhere without sun. i love pretending to be a cat and basking in the sunlight by the window, at this time of day the sun shines in perfectly in warm squares on my bed... best feeling everrr x ฅ^>⩊<^ ฅ`,

    content: `i had the best 21 of my life :) the night before my birthday, i had a little gathering with friends and sun helped me buy the goods and set up and let me host at their place. it was emo-themed and everyone at least attempted the theme, and i got to do people's eyeliner which was sm fun. i kind of bounced around all night taking pictures and talking to different ppl... it was really nice and i loved seeing everyone >,< i felt busy the entire night but not in an overwhelming way :) for afters we went out and caught like the last 10 minutes of a friend's party, and then we wrapped up the night at in n out :P on my actual birthday i took some meetings... and then sun came over and we both did goth makeup for the first time, like full out, traditional goth. when we were done we were like fuck it we should go out and scare some people, so we went to denny's to surprise sun's friends who were studying there T-T. we got a mix of reactions and comments on the way - the bad more or less balanced out the good. we took lots of pictures and laughed about how crazy we looked and how good that felt. it feels good. it feels good to be 21 :)`,

i remember in high school my ap literature teacher told one of my classmates that i had a strong voice in my writing, and it left a strong impression on me. i really liked his class and i even wrote him a card at the end of the year, saying how i learned a lot from him and that his class inspired me to want to write a book. now i'm not so sure if that's going to happen... maybe after i retire... but i wonder if he would even be alive by then and if he was, if he would read it. i was always a good student but not a favorite. never really liked talking to the teachers, but i got good grades and did the homework. 
    
i learned recently about a rumor that that teacher had inappropriate relations with one of my friends that was in his class with me... the same one that he talked about my writing to in fact... and that she went to his house to do ... ? it really shocked me but at the same time... i'm disappointed but not surprised. there was a lot of incidents like that at at my high school. i see you've also read lolita... and your playground is the classroom...`,

think less, do more: there will never be a time when you're completely free... you will always have to make time. appreciate the importance of doing nothing, too. 

you can fall in love with anyone: everyone is an artist. everyone's life is a story. art is everywhere

some things i did to welcome in the new year: 
- took a nap on the couch
- dyed my hair >.<
- looked into linuxOS (perhaps this is the year i become a linux user)
- bought a new domain for my site! (bunnyluv1 - i plan to try it out and kittenluv1 and just see which one sticks)

***

planning a major site refactor that involves moving everything to a framework, so a lot of things might go under construction for a while. this is good for the long term growth and scalability of my website... i think, according to my research (i asked chatgpt)

i noticed that my ‘new year's resolutions' from last year to this year haven't really changed much. i could take it as a sign of stagnation, that i'm not growing or challenging myself enough, but i kind of would rather see it as an indication of stability, like i've found goals for myself that i can continue to aim for even past the arbitrary term of one year. or perhaps in other words, new year, same me :p it's nice, not having to reinvent myself every year. also bcs i didn't fulfill my resolution of landing a kf last year (╥ᴗ╥) this is the year tho, i can feel it... `,
